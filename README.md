# This is my websrcaping mini app. For now it scrapes a single product page and reads values like : title, price, number of customers and recent sales. Allegro scraping is ditched at this moment, and I focused on website with some kids stuff that I'm interested in. You can find url for website I'm tracking in utils.py.

# This project is put on hold. I need to learn different approach of scraping. Since bs4 scrapes only HTML, I can't access values that are placed in CSS functions like :before and :after.

# It was a good practice tho.
