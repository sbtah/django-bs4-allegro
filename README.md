# This is my websrcaping mini app. For now it scrapes a single product page and reads values like : title, price, number of customers and recent sales.
# Allegro scraping is ditched at this moment, and I focused on website with some kids stuff that I'm interested in.
# You can find url for website I'm tracing in utils.py.
